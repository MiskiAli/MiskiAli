### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Miski Ali and welcome to my Github page. I have many projects on here that I used to help me learn out a number of programing languages. 
The main project on here that I hope you get the chance to check out is my solo project. So far I have gotten the chance to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SQL, Reat, Redux-Sagas and most recently .NET and C#.
